# MagistAnalysis
## An analysis of the suitability for a partnership as a method of market expansion
### An educational project at the WBS Coding School

This project makes use of SQL queries and Tableau visualization 
software on a slice of operationl data from the fictitious warehouse and
shipping management company Magist. The goal is to provide a recommendation
as to whether the "client" Eniac should pursue a short-term partnership 
with Magist as a way to gain entry to the Brazilian market.
